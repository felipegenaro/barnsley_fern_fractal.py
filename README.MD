## Fractals are fascinating patterns.

### For the computer generate this type of pattern, you just take a point and you apply some kind of transformation to it and then you plot that point and then you apply another transformation and you plot that point and you do it over and over and over again and you get this pattern.

``` bash

        $ pip install numpy
        $ pip install matplotlib

        # run your notebook and open this note
        $ jupyter notebook
